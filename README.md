The README is a **very important** document for the audit. Please fill it out thoroughly and include any other specific info that security experts will need in order to effectively review the codebase.

**Some pointers for filling out the section below:**  
ERC20/ERC721/ERC777/FEE-ON-TRANSFER/REBASING TOKENS:  
*Which tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts? Please note that these answers have a significant impact on the issues that will be submitted by Watsons. Please list specific tokens (ETH, USDC, DAI) where possible, otherwise "Any"/"None" type answers are acceptable as well.*

ADMIN:
*Admin/owner of the protocol/contracts.
Label as TRUSTED, If you **don't** want to receive issues about the admin of the contract being able to steal funds. 
If you want to receive issues about the Admin of the contract being able to steal funds, label as RESTRICTED & list specific acceptable/unacceptable actions for the admins.*

EXTERNAL ADMIN:
*These are admins of the protocols your contracts integrate with (if any). 
If you **don't** want to receive issues about this Admin being able to steal funds or result in loss of funds, label as TRUSTED
If you want to receive issues about this admin being able to steal or result in loss of funds, label as RESTRICTED.*
